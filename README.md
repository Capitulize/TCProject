This readme will detail to you, the user, how to run this program. 
1. You will have two jar files and three text files. One is called FileClient.jar, the other is called FileServer.jar. The text files are called XD.txt, lmao.txt, and Pride and Prejudice.txt. Put FileServer.jar in a folder you want to run in, and open up a command prompt.
2. In the command prompt, run FileServer.jar, make sure that the text files are in the same directory as the FileServer.jar.
3. With another computer, open up a command prompt there, and run FileClient.jar. You will see available files for you to download there. 
4. On FileClient, request the file that you want with either 1, 2, or 3. You will then receive the file.
5. Open the file and enjoy!
